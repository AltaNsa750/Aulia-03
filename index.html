                <h2>His Nickname</h2>
                <p>
                  Carlos Sainz's nicknames are "Chilli" and "Smooth Operator." Chilli was given for his aggressive racing style and tenacious fighting spirit when he started his Formula 1 career. Smooth Operator was given to him for his calm and intelligent demeanor both on and off the track, as well as his excellent driving skills, inspired by Sade's song "Smooth Operator."

                <h2>He Is On William's Teams</h2>
                <p>
                  Carlos Sainz is a driver for Atlassian Williams Racing, racing alongside Alex Albon for the 2025 season and beyond. He joins the team after four years at Scuderia Ferrari, where he finished on the podium several times and achieved four race wins.

                  Carlos Sainz has been living in Monaco since 2024, just five minutes from fellow F1 driver Charles Leclerc. This decision was likely influenced by the advantages of being in a tax-free country like Monaco, which attracts many other F1 drivers.
